# Tool
The code above is used to fetch historical versions of a website from the Wayback Machine, extract external domains from the HTML content of that version and save the extracted domains to a text file.
#
The code first sends a GET request to the Wayback Machine's API with the target URL and timestamp as parameters to retrieve the closest archived version of the website to the specified timestamp. The HTML content of this version is then extracted and passed to the get_domains function.
#
The get_domains function uses a regular expression to extract all external domains (i.e. domains that are not the same as the target URL) from the HTML content and returns the list of domains.
#
The ThreadPoolExecutor is used to run the get_domains function as a concurrent task. The result of the task is then saved to a text file.
#
This code can be used in a penetration testing or security assessment to identify external domains that may be associated with the target website, which could be useful in identifying potential attack vectors or areas of interest for further testing.
